Just take a hit of LSD and ride the trend. I was messing around with generating colors. I used a simple python script which helps with generating tradingview code blocks and loops.

Modify the following VARS in rainbow.py
* MAX_COLORS
* START_COLOR
* END_COLOR

Run the following:
```
$ poetry install

$ poetry shell

$ python rainbow.py
```

Copy and paste the output into the rainow.pine between the //GENERATED blocks.

Have fun.
