Just take a hit of LSD and ride the trend. I was messing around with generating colors. I used a simple python script which helps with generating tradingview code blocks and loops.

```
poetry install

poetry shell

Change the MAX_COLORS variable in rainbow.py.

python rainbow.py
```

Copy and paste the output into the rainow.pine between the //GENERATED blocks.

Have fun.
